One of the biggest challenges in enterprise AI adoption is getting agents built on different frameworks and vendors to work together. That‚Äôs why we created an open *Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol*, a collaborative way to help agents across different ecosystems communicate with each other. Google is driving this open protocol initiative for the industry because we believe this protocol will be **critical to support multi-agent communication by giving your agents a common language ‚Äì irrespective of the framework or vendor they are built on**. 
With *A2A*, agents can show each other their capabilities and negotiate how they will interact with users (via text, forms, or bidirectional audio/video) ‚Äì all while working securely together.

### Conceptual Overview

The Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol facilitates communication between independent AI agents. Here are the core concepts:

*   **Agent Card:** A public metadata file (usually at `/.well-known/agent.json`) describing an agent's capabilities, skills, endpoint URL, and authentication requirements. Clients use this for discovery.
*   **A2A Server:** An agent exposing an HTTP endpoint that implements the A2A protocol methods (defined in the [json specification](/specification)). It receives requests and manages task execution.
*   **A2A Client:** An application or another agent that consumes A2A services. It sends requests (like `tasks/send`) to an A2A Server's URL.
*   **Task:** The central unit of work. A client initiates a task by sending a message (`tasks/send` or `tasks/sendSubscribe`). Tasks have unique IDs and progress through states (`submitted`, `working`, `input-required`, `completed`, `failed`, `canceled`).
*   **Message:** Represents communication turns between the client (`role: "user"`) and the agent (`role: "agent"`). Messages contain `Parts`.
*   **Part:** The fundamental content unit within a `Message` or `Artifact`. Can be `TextPart`, `FilePart` (with inline bytes or a URI), or `DataPart` (for structured JSON, e.g., forms).
*   **Artifact:** Represents outputs generated by the agent during a task (e.g., generated files, final structured data). Artifacts also contain `Parts`.
*   **Streaming:** For long-running tasks, servers supporting the `streaming` capability can use `tasks/sendSubscribe`. The client receives Server-Sent Events (SSE) containing `TaskStatusUpdateEvent` or `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent` messages, providing real-time progress.
*   **Push Notifications:** Servers supporting `pushNotifications` can proactively send task updates to a client-provided webhook URL, configured via `tasks/pushNotification/set`.

**Typical Flow:**

1.  **Discovery:** Client fetches the Agent Card from the server's well-known URL.
2.  **Initiation:** Client sends a `tasks/send` or `tasks/sendSubscribe` request containing the initial user message and a unique Task ID.
3.  **Processing:**
    *   **(Streaming):** Server sends SSE events (status updates, artifacts) as the task progresses.
    *   **(Non-Streaming):** Server processes the task synchronously and returns the final `Task` object in the response.
4.  **Interaction (Optional):** If the task enters `input-required`, the client sends subsequent messages using the same Task ID via `tasks/send` or `tasks/sendSubscribe`.
5.  **Completion:** The task eventually reaches a terminal state (`completed`, `failed`, `canceled`).

### **What's next**

Future plans include improvements to the protocol itself and enhancements to the samples:

**Protocol Enhancements:**

    *   Formalize inclusion of authorization schemes and optional credentials directly within the `AgentCard`.
*   **Agent Collaboration:**
    *   Investigate a `QuerySkill()` method for dynamically checking unsupported or unanticipated skills.
*   **Task Lifecycle & UX:**
    *   Support for dynamic UX negotiation *within* a task (e.g., agent adding audio/video mid-conversation).
*   **Client Methods & Transport:**
    *   Explore extending support to client-initiated methods (beyond task management).
    *   Improvements to streaming reliability and push notification mechanisms.

**Sample & Documentation Enhancements:**

*   Simplify "Hello World" examples.
*   Include additional examples of agents integrated with different frameworks or showcasing specific A2A features.
*   Provide more comprehensive documentation for the common client/server libraries.
*   Generate human-readable HTML documentation from the JSON Schema.
